\section{Introduction}

Artificial neural networks are composed of distributed parallel systems 
and simple processing units ( nodes ) that compute certain functions 
Mathematical (typically nonlinear ). Such units are arranged in one or
more layers and interconnected by a large number of connections, usually
unidirectional. For most models these connections are associated with weights,
which store knowledge represented in the model and serve to weigh
input received by each neuron network . The operation of these networks is
inspired by a physical structure designed by nature : the human brain.

In this last decade there has been a tremendous growth in interest in the study
Artificial Neural Networks for the international community. This resumption of
interest in the area was provided mainly by the advance of technology,
especially microelectronics , which is allowing the physical implementation of
models of nodes and their connection modes and also the previously unthinkable
fact the Symbolist school not having achieved significant progress on tasks
simple for a human , even with their success in other areas problems .
The main objective of this work is to bring users nonspecialists
(mainly businesses ) applications that used the techniques of Networks
Artificial Neural that were both easy to use and
they needed a minimum of specific knowledge on the part of end users .
Were not enough reasons above, a deeper understanding of how
existing models work also provide more information for
researchers who are developing new models of neural networks
Artificial . A more comprehensive knowledge since the beginning of their studies
available to the researcher more precise information on which areas or
aspects models must be improved and that can be maintained for
the new network to be more efficient.
With these goals in mind we developed a prototype of a web application
easy access and use .
