\title{NeuroGrubi: a Web Application of Artificial Neural Networks Simulator}

\abstract{This paper aims to develop a methodology that facilitates the use 
of Artificial Neural Networks and more broadly to initiate a process of using 
the revolutionary techniques of Artificial Neural Networks in day-to-day, 
especially in business.
For this, we first proposed the development of a prototype simulator Artificial 
Neural Networks as web application, named NeuroGrubi, so people can not only 
use it, but also have access to the code. The Web was chosen because the easy 
access and availability offered to potential users of such systems.
The work will also indicate how this prototype can then be optimized and 
improved in the future to promote the use of techniques of Neural Networks. 
The purpose is to increase the use of neural networks technology by enterprises, 
leaving transparent to the end user, without specific details about the area.}
